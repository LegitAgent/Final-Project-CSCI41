# Final-Project-CSCI41
This project was created for our CSCI 41 (Information Management) final requirement.
Edit the .env.example file as needed to be a .env file with corresponding text inputs.

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Final-Project-CSCI41.git

```

## 2. Make a Python Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate
```

## 3. Install requirements.txt
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 4. Setup Environment Variables
Copy and edit the .env.example file to store all senestive information suchn as passwords, database credentials and etc.
Make sure to edit the file name to .env .

## 5. Set Up PostgreSQL
Assuming you have PostgreSQL installed, the command below should prompt you for your postgreSQL password.
```bash
psql -U postgres
```
Then create the database and user:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE finalproject;
CREATE USER finaluser WITH PASSWORD 'yourpassword';
```

The project should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

## SUPER IMPORTANT NOTES

- Make sure you never commit .env or your actual database credentials.
- Use .env.example as a template for others.
